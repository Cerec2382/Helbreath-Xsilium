Welcome to the Helbreath's continent.
 
In this continent there are 
two great city nations. One is the nation 
of Aresden where the God Aresien is
worshiped and the nation of Elvine which
worships the God Elvine.
 
You will be teleported to the designated
nation depending on the symbol you step on.


For now, you are just a wanderer who can 
freely pass through both nations.
However, as you chose one nationality
you shall enter into fierce battle
either with Aresden or Elvine who are
in war against one another.
