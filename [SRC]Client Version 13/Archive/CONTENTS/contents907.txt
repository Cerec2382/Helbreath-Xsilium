If you dies from the enemy or the
monster, you will lose experience

items, you had better deposit
items to the warehouse. Go to
the warehouse in the town, and
give item by drag-drop. And if
you want to take back from the
warehouse, click the warehouse
keeper and select 'Manage' menu.
Then you can see the item list
under deposit. Then click the item
from the list to take back item.
 
A character can hold 50items on
the bag, and can deposit 120items
on the warehouse.
 
And on 1 tile, you can drop items
until 12items. But if you drop
more than 12items, the server
do not remember the first item.
So be careful.
